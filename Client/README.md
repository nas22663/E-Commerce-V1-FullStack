## My process

- built backend apis first there .. most are not used then started on frontend was not so hard with the help of chat gpt since its been a while since i done frontend

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- NodeJs

### What I learned

it's a mess right .. i have just learned express node js and wanted to try to somewhat integerate them both frontend (css,html,js) and backend (nodejs) its not dynamic for sure but i will keep working on a landing page and try to make it fully functional hopefully
so backend apis are in server folder and frontend are in client folder
i really had trouble deploying the project so i ended up uploading backend on vercel and frontend on github 100% there is an easier way :D will try to look this stuff up more.

### Continued development

want to learn more about deployment of fullstack apps and deployment in general if anyone have any advice for me going forward please let me know
i want to also learn react to be a MERN developer

### Useful resources

had a lot of help from chatgpt building the frontend since i haven't done any css and dom related js in a while
